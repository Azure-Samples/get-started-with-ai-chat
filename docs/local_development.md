# Local Development Guide

This guide helps you set up a local development environment to test and modify the AI chat completion application. Make sure you first [deployed the app](#deploying-with-azd) to Azure before running the development server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- An Azure deployment of the application (completed via `azd up`)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Python Environment

Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it:

**On Windows:**
```shell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate
```

**On Linux:**
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `src` directory and install Python packages:

```shell
cd src
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory and setup for React UI:

```shell
cd src/frontend
pnpm run setup
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Fill in the environment variables in `.env` file in the `src` directory.

## Running the Development Server

### 1. Build Frontend (Optional)

If you have changes in `src/frontend`, build the React application:

```shell
cd src/frontend
pnpm build
```

The build output will be placed in the `../api/static/react` directory, where the backend can serve it.

### 2. Test Search Index Configuration (Optional)

If you have changes in `gunicorn.conf.py`, test the search index configuration:

```shell
cd src
python gunicorn.conf.py    
```

### 3. Start the Server

Run the local development server:

```shell
cd src
python -m uvicorn "api.main:create_app" --factory --reload
```

### 4. Access the Application

Click '<http://127.0.0.1:8000>' in the terminal, which should open a new tab in the browser. Enter your message in the box to test the chat completion.

## Frontend Development and Customization

If you want to modify the frontend application, the key component to understand is `src/frontend/src/components/agents/AgentPreview.tsx`. This component handles:

- **Backend Communication**: Contains the main logic for calling the backend API endpoints
- **Message Handling**: Manages the flow of user messages and chat responses
- **UI State Management**: Controls the display of conversation history and loading states

### Key Areas for Customization

- **Chat Interaction Flow**: Modify how users interact with the chat by updating the message handling logic in `AgentPreview.tsx`
- **UI Components**: Customize the chat interface, message bubbles, and response formatting
- **API Integration**: Extend or modify the backend communication patterns established in this component

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to React components in `src/frontend/src/`
2. Run `pnpm build` to compile the frontend
3. The build output is automatically placed in `../api/static/react` for the backend to serve
4. Restart the local server to see your changes

Start with `AgentPreview.tsx` to understand how the frontend communicates with the backend and how messages are populated in the UI.

## Search Index and RAG Customization

This application uses Azure AI Search to provide Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The system prompts the chat completion model with relevant context retrieved from a search index.

### How RAG Works in This Application

1. **Pre-computed Embeddings**: The application uses pre-computed embeddings stored in `src/api/data/embeddings.csv`
2. **Search Index Creation**: On startup, `gunicorn.conf.py` creates an Azure AI Search index and uploads the embeddings
3. **Query-time Search**: When users ask questions, the system searches for relevant context and includes it in the prompt
4. **Chat Completion**: The chat completion model responds using both the user's message and the retrieved context

### Updating the Knowledge Base

To update the knowledge base that the RAG system uses:

#### Modifying the Embeddings Data

1. **Update the CSV**: Modify `src/api/data/embeddings.csv` with your new data
2. **CSV Format**: The file should contain pre-computed embeddings and associated text content
3. **Restart or Redeploy**: The search index is only created once at startup, so you need to:
   - Delete the existing search index in Azure AI Search, then restart the application, OR
   - Run `azd deploy` again to recreate the infrastructure

#### Important Notes About Data Updates

- **One-time Upload**: The embeddings are only uploaded when the search index is first created
- **Manual Index Management**: If you need to update data, you must manually delete the existing index or redeploy
- **No File Directory**: This application does not use individual files from a `src/files/` directory
- **CSV Only**: The RAG system exclusively uses the `embeddings.csv` file for its knowledge base

### Customizing the RAG Behavior

#### Search Configuration
- Modify the search logic in `SearchIndexManager` class (`src/api/search_index_manager.py`)
- Adjust search parameters, scoring, and result filtering

#### Prompt Engineering
- Update the RAG prompt template in `src/api/routes.py` (around line 115)
- Customize how retrieved context is formatted and presented to the model

#### Model Configuration
- Change the chat completion model via the `AZURE_AI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` environment variable
- Adjust embedding model via the `AZURE_AI_EMBED_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` environment variable
